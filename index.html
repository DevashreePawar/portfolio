            <h3>Student Researcher - University of Arizona</h3>
            <p>As a Student Researcher in the AI and healthcare domain, I am developing a Multimodal Mixture of Experts (MMoE) model that integrates medical imaging (X-rays, MRIs), clinical narratives, and structured patient data to enhance disease prediction accuracy. My work involves building data pipelines, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for cross-modal reasoning, and applying prompt engineering and NLP techniques to extract insights from unstructured healthcare text. I train and deploy deep learning models using PyTorch, TensorFlow, and High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems, while collaborating closely with medical researchers, AI engineers, and data scientists to bridge technical innovation with real-world healthcare impact.</p>

        <div class="exp-card">
            <h3>Machine Learning Intern - Care Risk Solutions</h3>
            <p>During my internship at Care Risk Solution, I developed machine learning models for large-scale banking data analysis to identify credit risk patterns, achieving a 15% improvement in prediction accuracy. I explored quantum-inspired optimization methods, including Variational Quantum Classifiers (VQCs) and quantum kernel approaches, comparing them with classical ML models. My contributions included building robust feature engineering pipelines, optimizing data preprocessing workflows, and implementing classification and regression techniques using Python, Scikit-learn, and NumPy, resulting in reduced processing time and enhanced model performance.</p>

        <div class="exp-card">
            <h3>Data Analytics Intern - Bhundal Infotech</h3>
            <p>At Bhundal Infotech, I streamlined operations by creating end-to-end automation workflows with UiPath, reducing manual effort and improving data accuracy. I developed SQL-based pipelines for data extraction, validation, and storage, ensuring timely and reliable information flow. By collaborating with business teams, I designed automation solutions that increased process efficiency by 20% and integrated RPA solutions with APIs for seamless execution. My work also focused on eliminating data bottlenecks, supporting reporting optimization, and ensuring smooth scalability for automation initiatives.</p>
